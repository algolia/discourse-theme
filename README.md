# Algolia Discouse Community Theme

Discourse theme for Algolia community forum: https://discourse.algolia.com

ðŸš¨ Note that only `desktop.scss` is used. Everything under `algolia.scss` and `algolia` folder 
was imported from the previous setup.

[We cannot `@import` yet](https://meta.discourse.org/t/breaking-up-common-scss-into-multiple-files-in-components/110417),
I copied and pasted everything inside the `desktop.scss`, we'll clean this up when the feature is introduced.
